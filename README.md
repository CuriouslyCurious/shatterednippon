A complete overhaul to Europa Universalis IV in which feudal Japan replaces the original map.

This mod is modeled after the excellent (but somewhat laggy) ShatteredEuropa, as such it does not strive to be historically accurate. All it is is a fun and interesting map for everyone to play BlobSimulator [CURRENT_YEAR] on. ;)

Primarly designed for SwedditUniversalis' multiplayer sessions.
