# shatterednippon
A complete overhaul to Europa Universalis IV in which feudal Japan replaces the original map by Curious and StabShot.

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CuriouslyCurious/shatterednippon/master/shatterednippon/map/provinces.bmp)

This mod is modeled after the excellent (but somewhat laggy) ShatteredEuropa, as such it does not strive to be historically accurate. All it is is a fun and interesting map for everyone to play BlobSimulator [CURRENT_YEAR] on. ;)

Primarly designed for SwedditUniversalis' multiplayer sessions.

This repo holds some useful scripts for mod making as well.

Idea by: StabShot
