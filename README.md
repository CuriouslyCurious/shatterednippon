This mod is modeled after the excellent (but somewhat laggy) ShatteredEuropa, as such it does not strive to be historically accurate. All it is is a fun and interesting map for everyone to play BlobSimulator [CURRENT_YEAR] on. ;)

Primarly designed for SwedditUniversalis' multiplayer sessions.

This repo holds some useful scripts for mod making as well.
