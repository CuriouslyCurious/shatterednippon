A complete overhaul to Europa Universalis IV in which feudal Japan replaces the original map.

This mod is modeled after the excellent (but somehwat laggy) ShatteredEuropa as such it does not strive to be historically accurate, just a fun and interesting map to play on. ;)

Primarly designed for SwedditUniversalis' multiplayer sessions.
