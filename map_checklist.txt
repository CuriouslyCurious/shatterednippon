Checklist Map:

	Completed:

	Provinces.bmp
	Terrain.bmp
	world_normal.bmp
	heightmap.bmp
	continent.txt - don't think we want to split the map up in continents
	provicegroup.txt - serves no use?
	seasons.txt
	
	Psuedo-complete:
	
	default.map - needs sea_starts (and possible lakes) defined.
	area.txt - needs to be split up in to smaller areas, province numbers geography needs to be corrected and sea tile areas need to be defined.
	definition.csv - is just missing names for all the provinces but passable atm.
	climate.txt - needs to be properly split according to climate, and mountains possibly need to be added.
